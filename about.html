        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        Hey, I am Hakkei~ If you do not know me and found this website, that is very surprising. To be clear, I am not sure who I am either. But here are four words to start:  
        Bird, Statue of David, Leonardo da Vinci, Buddha. These are the four role models I care about, the direction of my life.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Bird</h3>
        <p>
        Bird represents my social life: I care about being in a community with a strong sense of connection. Like birds flock together, I love hanging out with people.  
        I am very spontaneous.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Statue of David</h3>
        <p>
        The Statue of David represents my physical life: Just like the Statue of David, I want to maintain the aesthetics of my body but also treat it in a healthy way for the long term. This includes eating certain foods, exercising regularly (mainly calisthenics), and getting quality sleep.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Leonardo da Vinci</h3>
        <p>
        Leonardo da Vinci represents my academic life: I love learning because I am curious. Period. That is the only reason I learn. Especially interdisciplinary subjects, but not just scratching the surface of each, rather diving deeper and connecting them. Like da Vinci, I want to approach every opportunity for learning from a course of curiosity and create something useful out of it by connecting disciplines.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Buddha</h3>
        <p>
        Buddha represents my mental life: Having peace within myself is crucial. Besides that, there is not much I can do or a point in doing anything. I deeply care about the practice of meditation and self-reflection. This comes in the form of relaxing, staying peaceful, and observing myself through the art of journaling.
